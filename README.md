### Project Title:
Risk Analysis in Banking and Financial Services using Data Analytics and Visualization

### Project Objective:
To identify and evaluate key financial and customer behavior risk factors using data analytics techniques, with the goal of helping banks make data-driven decisions to minimize defaults, credit risk, and customer churn.

### Project Description:
This project involves analyzing banking data to assess potential risks associated with loans, deposits, and customer segments. It leverages data analytics tools like Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib), SQL, and Power BI to:

Understand the distribution of loan defaults, deposit patterns, and credit card usage.

Evaluate customer risk levels based on factors such as income band, occupation, nationality, and account activity.

Develop interactive Power BI dashboards with KPIs like:

Total Clients

Total Loans / Bank Loans / Business Lending

Total Deposits / Bank Deposits

Checking and Savings Account Amounts

Total Credit Card Amount and Balance

Estimated Income Analysis

Loan Risk by Occupation and Nationality

Loyalty Classification Patterns

Using both statistical and visual methods, the project identifies high-risk customer profiles, loan performance trends, and early indicators of financial instability, supporting smarter risk management strategies for banking institutions.
